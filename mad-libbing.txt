Fighting evil by torch-light, winning love by monitor-light,
Never running from a pizza, she is the one named Mom.

She will never turn her back on her BBQ.
She is always there to party.
She is the one in whom we can trust.

She is the one named Sailorrrrrr ...

Sailor Moon!
Sailor Moon!
Sailor Moon!
Sailor Moon!

With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one named Bubble Gum.
